            It can be difficult to deal with finances sometimes. Whether it be paying bills, budgeting, or saving money,
            dealing with finances is an important part of everyday life. By knowing your net monthly income, you can
            list your monthly spending habits with a check register. Getting a glimpse of what the annual salary of what
            some careers have would give you a vision of what career would be able to provide for you. Using a 50/30/20
            budget calculator could give you an idea of how to disperse your money sparingly. How will you choose to
            handle your finances?
